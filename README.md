# Encryption
---
Encryption is a program used to encrypt or decrypt a text by rotating letters or numbers by a certain number of positions. How many positions the programm rotates is up to the user!
The text can contain letters (capital or not), digits and special characters. The special characters, however, do not get rotated and stay as they are.

## Installation
Follow these steps to use the program with Intellij:
1. download and install the most suitable version of [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for your computer
2. Open Intellij and choose a directory to clone the programm to
3. Open the project in Intellij IDEA

You should be able to use the project and code now.

## How to Use the Project
Once you start the programm, a menu will be opened on your command line. You can choose one of the following options:
- Encrypt
- Decrypt
- Quit

##### 1. Encrypt:
- When you choose Encrypt, the first thing you will get asked is to put in your rotation. Depending on which number you choose, the method will rotate the text by the amount.
- Afterwards you will have the chance to choose which text you want to have encrypted. Simply choose something to your liking, and the programm will do the rest for you.
- Lastly, the programm will show you your encrypted text and will open the menu again, so you can choose the next option.

##### 2. Decrypt
- When you choose Decrypt, the first thing you will get asked is to put in your rotation. Depending on which number you choose, the method will rotate the text by the amount, simply in the opposite direction as the encryption.
- Afterwards you will have the chance to choose which text you want to have decrypted. Simply choose something to your liking, and the programm will do the rest for you.
- Lastly, the programm will show you your decrypted text and will open the menu again, so you can choose the next option.

##### 3. Quit
- If you don't want to use the project anymore, you can just use the option quit to close the running programm.
