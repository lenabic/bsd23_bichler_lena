## Why are logging libraries used?

Logging libraries are used to record information about the runtime behavior of an application. 
They collect and store log messages, which can be crucial for debugging, monitoring, and auditing purposes.

## Log Levels in Log4J

Log4J defines several log levels, including:

- **TRACE**: The most detailed level. Used for very fine-grained information.
- **DEBUG**: Used for debugging information that is useful during development and debugging stages.
- **INFO**: General information messages to indicate the progress of the application.
- **WARN**: Indicates potential issues that do not necessarily prevent the application from functioning.
- **ERROR**: Indicates errors that might still allow the application to continue running.
- **FATAL**: The highest severity level, indicates very severe errors that will most likely lead to application failure.

The choice of log level determines the granularity of information logged.

## Configuration Options in Log4J

Log4J offers extensive configuration options:

- **Loggers and Appenders**: Define where log messages go (e.g., console, file, database).
- **Log Levels**: Configure the minimum level of log messages to be captured.
- **Layouts**: Specify how log messages are formatted.
- **Filters**: Allow selective logging based on certain criteria (e.g., package name, log level).
- **Rolling Policies**: Define how log files are rolled over or archived based on size, time, etc.

These configurations can be specified in a `log4j2.xml` file or programmatically.
