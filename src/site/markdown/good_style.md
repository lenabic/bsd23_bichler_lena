# Good Style While Coding

## writing good source code comments
- Purposeful Content: Comments should explain why something is done, not what is obvious from the code.
- Update Consistently: Keep comments synchronized with code changes to avoid confusion.
- Avoid Redundancy: Don't repeat code; instead, clarify intent or decision-making.
- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear language without unnecessary jargon or abbreviations.
- Consistent Style: Follow a uniform commenting style throughout the codebase.
- Document Assumptions: Note any assumptions or edge cases handled by the code.
- Complex Logic: Explain intricate algorithms or workarounds thoroughly.

## writing good git commit messages
- Clear Subject Line: Use the imperative mood and summarize the change in 50 characters or less.
- Detailed Explanation: Provide a brief body after a blank line for additional context.
- Specify Changes: Mention what the commit addresses or fixes.
- Link Issues: Reference relevant issues or tickets using hashtags or links (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- Be Brief yet Descriptive: Convey the intent of the commit clearly and succinctly.
- Proofread: Check for errors to maintain professionalism and clarity.
- Follow Guidelines: Adhere to project or team-specific commit message conventions for consistency.
